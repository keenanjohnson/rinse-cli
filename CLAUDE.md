Project context for AI-assisted development. Read this before making changes.

## What this is

`rinse` — a Rust CLI that streams Rinse FM (or any Icecast/Shoutcast URL),
plays the audio, and renders a live terminal spectrum visualizer with
now-playing metadata. Single binary, five crate deps (`ratatui`,
`crossterm`, `rustfft`, `native-tls`, `serde_json`), external runtime
dependency on ffmpeg/ffplay.

## Commands

```bash
cargo build --release          # build
cargo clippy                   # lint (not yet clean — see Known debt)
cargo fmt                      # format

# End-to-end test without network access to the real stream:
python3 tools/fake_icecast.py &          # serves 127.0.0.1:8899
./target/release/rinse-rs --url http://127.0.0.1:8899/stream --no-audio
```

There are no unit tests yet. The fake Icecast server is the primary test
harness — it exercises ICY header parsing, metaint metadata extraction,
decode, FFT, and rendering. `tools/fake_icecast.py` requires python3 and
ffmpeg (it generates its own test AAC on first run if test.aac is missing —
see file header).

## Architecture (all in src/main.rs, ~450 lines)

```
[icy_thread] ──raw AAC──> ffplay stdin        (audio playback)
             ──raw AAC──> ffmpeg stdin ──s16le PCM──> [pcm_thread]
                                                          │
                                          sync_channel<Vec<i16>> (bounded 64)

[main thread]  ratatui draw loop <── Spectrum (FFT + smoothing)
```

- `icy_thread` / `stream_once`: raw HTTP/1.0 over `TcpStream`. Deliberately
  NOT an HTTP library: ICY servers can reply `ICY 200 OK` which strict
  clients reject. Parses `icy-metaint`, strips interleaved metadata blocks,
  extracts `StreamTitle='…';`. Reconnects forever on error (2s backoff).
- Fanout writes to both child stdins via `buffered_sink` (a per-sink writer
  thread + unbounded queue). Errors ignored per-sink so one dead child
  doesn't kill the other. The buffering is load-bearing: without it, ffplay
  only pulls its pipe at real-time playback pace, back-pressuring the shared
  fanout in bursts that starve ffmpeg between refills — the visualizer then
  spikes every few seconds instead of tracking the audio. Note: ffmpeg races
  through Icecast's burst-on-connect while ffplay plays it out, so the
  visualizer runs a few seconds ahead of the audio.
- `pcm_thread`: reads exact 2048-frame chunks, `try_send` so chunks DROP
  when the UI is behind — this keeps the visualizer realtime, never laggy.
- `Spectrum`: 2048-pt FFT @ 44.1kHz mono, Hann window, log-spaced bands
  45 Hz–16 kHz. Smoothing: attack `0.3*old + 0.7*new`, decay
  `0.82*old + 0.18*new`, peak dots fall 0.02/frame. The `ln_1p` scaling and
  1.0→1.6 high-band tilt are cosmetic tuning — change freely by eye.
- UI: manual `Line`/`Span` rendering (not ratatui's BarChart — it can't do
  per-row gradient colors or partial-block bar tips). 256-color ramp in
  `RAMP`, falls back implicitly via terminal. Bands recompute when the
  terminal is too narrow (`set_bands` on resize).
- Shared state (`show`/`title`/`station`/`status`) via `Arc<Mutex<StreamState>>`.
- `now_playing_thread`: Rinse's audio stream only sends a placeholder
  `StreamTitle`, so for Rinse URLs we poll their schedule API
  (`www.rinse.fm/api/query/v1/schedule`) every 60s and publish the on-air
  *show* name (`show`, preferred over the ICY `title` in the header). The
  stream mount maps to a channel slug (`rinse_uk`→`uk`); non-Rinse URLs skip
  the poller and just show ICY metadata. Episode air time = `episodeDate`
  (broadcast day, London-midnight in UTC) + `episodeTime`'s time-of-day.
- Exit uses `std::process::exit(0)` because icy_thread may be blocked in a
  socket read; children are killed first. If refactoring shutdown, keep this
  in mind or add socket timeouts + joins.

## Decision records

1. **Decoding: shell out to ffmpeg** (vs Symphonia vs fdk-aac bindings).
   Rinse's stream is aacPlus (HE-AAC = AAC-LC + SBR). Symphonia only decodes
   the LC core (duller highs, dead upper visualizer bands); fdk-aac decodes
   HE-AAC fully but its license is GPL-incompatible and distro-unfriendly
   (Debian non-free). Plan: keep ffmpeg-pipe as default, add optional cargo
   features `symphonia` and `fdk` later so users choose their tradeoff.
2. **https via native-tls**: the reliably-live public Rinse mount is HTTPS
   (`https://admin.stream.rinse.fm/proxy/rinse_uk/stream`, the default URL),
   so `connect()` wraps the `TcpStream` in `native_tls` for `https://` URLs.
   native-tls uses the OS trust store (Security.framework on macOS, OpenSSL
   on Linux). The old plain-http admin mount (`:8820/stream`) is a silent
   failover feed. Both http and https URLs still work via `--url`.
3. **No CLI-parsing crate**: hand-rolled `parse_args` to keep deps minimal.
   If flags grow past ~5, switch to `clap` with `derive`.

## Known debt / gotchas

- Built and tested on rustc 1.75 in the original dev sandbox, which required
  pinning `instability` and `unicode-segmentation` (ratatui 0.29 transitive
  deps want 1.85+). **Cargo.lock was intentionally not committed** — on a
  current stable toolchain, fresh resolution works with no pins. Commit a
  fresh Cargo.lock from your machine.
- `cargo clippy` has not been run clean yet.
- Stream URL is a hardcoded const (`RINSE_URL`). Fine for now.
- The metadata regex-free parser assumes `StreamTitle='…';` — titles
  containing `';` will truncate. Icecast escapes rarely; low priority.
- Tested only on Linux. macOS should just work. Windows: ratatui/crossterm
  are compatible but ffplay pipe behavior is unverified.
- When testing under `script`(1) for headless pty runs, set a size first
  (`stty rows 30 cols 110`) — a 0×0 pty makes draw_frame return early and
  nothing renders.

## Style

- Single-file until it hurts. Likely first split: `icy.rs`, `spectrum.rs`,
  `ui.rs`.
- Prefer std over new dependencies unless there's a clear win.
- Visualizer tuning constants are feel-based; when changing them, verify
  against the fake server (steady tones) AND real music.
